# STAFF ANALYSIS DASHBOARDS

This site contains dashboards to provide detailed analysis of team data for work and time permitting the users to filter data displays as required. There are 2 dashboards in the
site, the first graphs staff records filtering by work completed and also contains a filtered table for better visualisation. The 2nd page provides analysis of the time utilised for
that the work.

The intention of the design and development is to meet requirements of management and move the team to a more automated analysis work style, enabling users to run analysis on demand
without the requirement to export data to other systems or manually create graphical representations of data when required.

The dashboards can be accessed by clicking "here"

# UX

The design scope was created from the request by management and team members to provide a better method of viewing task & time details than is currently employed by the team.

The first requirement was to evaluate the current method of analysis employed and to then design dashboards to replicate and improve where possible. The manager and team were engaged
to relate their existing limitations and then provide a detailed scope for the development of the dashboards.

The current method of analysis requires the data to be exported from our Sharepoint repository and inserted in an Excel spreadsheet so that graphs and tables can be enabled to
display the required data.

## User Stories

### Manager

As a manager I need to have details on hand to show what tasks have been completed
by my team over particular reporting periods and also to be able to evaluate the number of hours
taken up in the completion of these tasks.

As the team work across multiple platforms covering a variety of work types and priorities, it is invaluable
to have up to date records of this work in a form that is easy to understand and to be able to drill
down on.

During staff reviews or work scheduling it would be a great advantage to have the latest data available for analysis or presentation
to others and the dashboard design is seen as the best solution to my issues.

The current method is very time consuming and requires exports to be constantly updated with the latest data which is not ideal when working
in such a time sensitive environment and the need to be able to re-classify work priorities or distribute new tasks appropriately will
result in better work conditions for the staff and provide me with the necessary data on hand to be able to manage our task load in a more efficent manner.
